Findings

1) for mouse B128, the capomulin drug successfully helped reduce the tumor size over time
We know this because the line chart shows a downward slope of tumor size over time

2) Infubinol and ceftamin were not as effective as capomulin and ramicane.
We know this because their tumor sizes at the end of the study were must larger for Infubinol and ceftamin than for capomulin and ramicane.
As shown by the box plots

3) there is trend that exists between your weight and average tumor size
The heavier you are, the bigger the tumor size.
We can see this in the scatter plot that shows a positive relationship between weight and tumor volume in the mice of this study
